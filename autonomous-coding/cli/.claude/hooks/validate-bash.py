Bash Command Security Hook for Autonomous Coding Agent (CLI version)
=====================================================================

Pre-tool-use hook that validates bash commands for security.
Uses an allowlist approach - only explicitly permitted commands can run.

Exit codes:
  0 = allow the command
  2 = block the command (stderr message shown to Claude)

This is a standalone script version of security.py, adapted for Claude Code CLI hooks.
